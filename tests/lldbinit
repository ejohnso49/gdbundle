# Copy-Paste the sample_lldbinit.py file somewhere
# $ mv gdbundle/sample_lldbinit.py ~/lldbinit.py

# LLDB seems to have different behavior when using command script vs script
# It's not clear what the difference is but using a plain script seems to allow for the loading
# of modules successfully. So we instead setup things with tests.lldbinit, initialize gdbundle,
# then run a basic test
script import tests.lldbinit
script import gdbundle; gdbundle.init()
script import basic_tests; basic_tests.main()
# command script import 'tests/basic_tests.py'
